# Judge0 Setup Guide

## üöÄ Setting Up Judge0

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Refer to the official Judge0 documentation for complete and up-to-date instructions: [Judge0 Docs](https://github.com/judge0/judge0)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Linux OS (preferably Ubuntu)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

---

## üì¶ Clone the Judge0 Docker Image

Clone the latest Judge0 version (e.g., `judge0-v1-13-1`):

```bash
wget https://github.com/judge0/judge0/releases/download/v1.13.1/judge0-v1.13.1.zip
unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Environment

### 1. GRUB Configuration

Make necessary adjustments to your GRUB settings if you're running Ubuntu [Check the official documentation](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#deployment-procedure).

### 2. Judge0 Environment Variables

- Set a strong password for **Redis**
- Set a strong password for **PostgreSQL**

You can generate secure random passwords from [this website](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=32&format=plain&rnd=new).

Update these values in the `judge0.conf` file inside the cloned Judge0 directory.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Workers and Batch Limits

You can customize the number of Judge0 workers based on:

- Expected number of users
- Expected submission volume
- Available system memory

> üîß The number of test cases processed in one submission batch is **20 by default**, but you may adjust it in the configuration file.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Judge0

Run the following commands to launch Judge0 and its dependencies:

```bash
docker compose up -d redis db       # Start Redis and PostgreSQL containers
sleep 10s                           # Wait for containers to be ready
docker compose up -d                # Start Judge0 API and workers
sleep 5s                            # Final wait for complete startup
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Considerations

Ensure your system has **sufficient memory** to run Judge0 smoothly.

- **Java** submissions may fail to compile if your system is low on memory.
- **Python 3.11** and other lightweight languages usually run fine for short execution times.
- Compilation or runtime errors could indicate insufficient memory resources.
